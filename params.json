Download [latest zip file](https://github.com/Landish/Alfred.GoogleChromeDevMode/archive/master.zip) on your computer and unzip it.\r\n2. Open **Alfred App Preferences** and switch to \"**Workflows**\" tab.\r\n3. Drag \"**GoogleChromeDevMode.alfredworkflow**\" file from downloaded archive and drop it to left sidebar.\r\n4. Type \"**dws**\" (stands for \"Disable Web Security\") on Alfred window to open Google Chrome with disabled Web Security. \r\n\r\n#Manual Mode\r\nIf you don't want use this extension and just want to open Google Chrome with disabled Web Security, then just run the following command in **Terminal**:\r\n```\r\nopen -a Google\\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security\r\n```\r\n\r\n#Images\r\n![Alfred Google Chrome Developer Mode](https://raw.github.com/Landish/Alfred.GoogleChromeDevMode/master/images/preview.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
